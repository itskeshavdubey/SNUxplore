# SNUxplore.

![logo](../SNUxplore/images/logo.png)

A website developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to help people explore and navigate through Shiv Nadar University's campus easily and more efficiently. We also offer a functionality to call/mail all the hostel wardens and all the official buildings on campus

## General Use Cases

- Parents who come to visit their wards for short durations, often find it troublesome to navigate through the college
- Local guardians or guests who come to the campus for visits or official work
- ✨And last but not the least, all the students and faculty

## How to Run This Project Locally?

This procedure requires [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/)

1. Make a new folder on your PC, open it and then right click anywhere in the empty folder
2. Choose "Git Bash Here"
3. Run the folowing command in the Git Bash Terminal

```sh
git clone https://github.com/keshavdubeysnu/SNUxplore.git
```

This will clone the repo in that folder and you can now locally access the code
To view the pages, just navigate to the "home" folder and double click on "index.html". This should open the project in your browser.

## Future Plans

We intend to finish the data collection part at the earliest, would be more than happy if any of you wanted to contribute in this regard.

Additionally, if you have ANY ideas, feature requests, improvements on your mind, feel free to reach out to either of us. We'll be elated to hear from you, there are no bad or silly ideas, just different perspectives😄

## For Developers in SNU

Just began learning HTML or been an ameteur web developer for long? And want a project to use as a playground?
This is THE project for you. Go ahead, change the background colors, roast our bad coding practices using comments, rename the CSS class names, whatever!

But in this process, if you do end up developing an improvement to the site or adding a new feture, make a pull request after forking the repo. We'll merge all the good PR's we get.
