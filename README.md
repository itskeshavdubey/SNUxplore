<hr />

A website developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to help people explore and navigate through Shiv Nadar University's campus easily and more efficiently. We also offer a functionality to call/mail all the hostel wardens and all the official buildings on campus.

## General Use Cases

- Parents who come to visit their wards for short durations, find it troublesome to navigate through the college. They can use the website to find all the locations on campus according to their needs
- Local guardians or guests who come to the campus for visits or official work can navigate to the building of their choice, hassle free
- âœ¨And last but not the least, all the students and faculty who may require an official building's/hostel wareden's contact details, or at times even a navigation route when lost or in an emergency
